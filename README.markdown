This project contains code to produce text output from executable
templates, containing mixed text and C# or VB.NET code, sort of like
old-style ASP code.

Repository and project location: [CodePlex][1]  
Maintainer: [Lasse V. Karlsen][2]

**NOTE**: This code is still very, *very*, much in flux. Do not use this
in anything remotely related to production code. Expect methods to gain
new parameters, be overloaded, or to disappear completely.

**You have been warned!**
